# Welcome to the Embedded Viz Blog

## Purpose
The topics covered will be things that interest me. That generally means they'll be about embedded/OEM/SaaS topics for data visualization and reporting with a helping of database and maybe some philosophy/lessons learned from a long and varied career.

Unlike a lot over blogs that cover visualizations, don't expect a lot of visual stuff and design. I'm much more likely to cover performance, coding, administration and security

## Frequency of content
TBD. Honestly, I'm not sure, probably 1-2 time/month

For now, I have a LOT of content that has been used primarily for internal use at [Cerner](https://www.cerner.com). I'll be mixing that will new ideas, so there will likely be a more frequent cadence until I work through that backlog.

# About me

My areas of responsibility include the overall direction for our Tableau and SAP Business Objects infrastructure which covers multiple production Tableau Server farms totaling over 200 Cores and 700+ Tableau Desktops.
